# Task tracker agent
A simple ReAct agent that manages tasks/todos and projects.

## Goals (for now)
My technical goals for this project is as follows:
* Build a ReAct agent that can create, update, list and delete tasks
* Implement a custom event stream to capture all 'events' happening inside the agent loop
* Use structured output and define clear interfaces so that I can easily switch to tool calling if needed
* Create a prover agnostic LLM wrapper

These are just my goals **for now**, I'll update this file as I implement more and more things.
