# Mastering AI Agents & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Todo List

## Foundations
- [ ] Review fundamentals of AI agents
- [ ] Study types of agents: reactive, deliberative, hybrid
- [ ] Understand multi-agent systems
- [ ] Learn basics of language models (LLMs)
- [ ] Explore core NLP concepts

## RAG Concepts
- [ ] Understand what RAG is and why it matters
- [ ] Study architecture of RAG systems
- [ ] Learn about retrievers vs. generators
- [ ] Review vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
- [ ] Read on embedding models (SBERT, OpenAI, etc.)

## Implementation
- [ ] Set up an environment for RAG experimentation (Python, Conda, etc.)
- [ ] Install and configure a vector database
- [ ] Index documents using embeddings
- [ ] Integrate retrieval with LLM (such as OpenAI GPT)
- [ ] Implement a simple retrieval-augmented chatbot

## Advanced Topics
- [ ] Fine-tune a retriever model
- [ ] Experiment with custom retrieval strategies
- [ ] Study prompt engineering for RAG
- [ ] Handle long context and memory management
- [ ] Evaluate system performance and accuracy

## Ecosystem & Tools
- [ ] Explore existing RAG frameworks (Haystack, LlamaIndex, LangChain, etc.)
- [ ] Compare cloud offerings vs. open-source
- [ ] Integrate third-party APIs for knowledge sources

## Research & Community
- [ ] Read seminal RAG papers
- [ ] Join forums/communities focused on RAG and agents
- [ ] Keep up to date with current research
- [ ] Document learnings & share insights publicly
